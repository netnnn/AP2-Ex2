<h1 align="center">AP2-EX2</h1>

<div align="center">
  An internet chat application made with HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT, JQUERY, and REACT. <br/>
  The app contains a login screen, a register screen, and the main chat screen. <br/>
</div>

For the sake of the exercise and debugging, some users and messages between them are already registered in the data base: <br/>
Name: "Unknown" Password: "lll" <br/>
Name: "yagami" Password: "yyy" <br/>
Name: "misa" Password: "mmm" <br/>
Name: "watari" Password: "www" <br/>
Name: "matsuda" Password: "mmm" <br/>
These users are hard coded into the data base and these passwords were allowed to be short for the sake of debugging and testing. <br/>

Regardless, you can register with a new profile for yourself, a nickname and a local image of your choice, and add new contacts to chat with, as you wish, so long they exist. <br/>

Features: <br/>
-Dark mode and Bright mode setting, which the app remembers for each user seperatly, even after logging out. <br/>
-Error messages when trying to register with invalid input that the fields require. <br/>
-Displays the number of messages waiting to be read in a chat. <br/>
-The user can add a new contact to chat with if he is registered in the data base, and relevant error messages when somethings wrong. <br/>
-The user can scroll up and down the chat when its long, for instance, in the chat of user "yagami" (light) and "Unknown" (L). <br/>
-When rendering a new message, the chat automatically scrolls all the way down to show the new message. <br/>
-The app displays the last message in the chat with a contact, along with the time it was sent, just under the contacts profile. <br/>
-When user A sends a message to user B, you can logout using the logout button, login to user B, and see the new message that user A sent! <br/>
-Every input written to a field, can also be submitted by simply pressing the Enter button, whether it is the register, login, or main screen. <br/>
-Refreshing the page reverts all changes and takes you back to the login screen. <br/>
-You can also start a chat with yourself. For the comfort of the user, the chat will be named "You". <br/>
